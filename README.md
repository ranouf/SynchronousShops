# SynchronousShops
Synchronizes Etsy Shop and Instagram Shop

The app will get all the items from your Etsy Shop and verify that they are on your Instagram Shop too:
- if an article is missing it will be created in your Instagram Shop
- if an article is sold in a shop it will be marked as sold in the other shop

The app won't keep Item's information exept item's Ids from Etsy Shop and Instagram that will be saved.
